# HeaderHunter

Header Hunter is a Rust-based tool designed for auditing HTTP headers of web applications for security vulnerabilities. It analyzes headers for potential risks and provides suggestions for improvement based on predefined patterns and severity scores.

## Dependencies

reqwest: HTTP client for sending requests and fetching responses.

regex: Library for handling regular expressions in header analysis.

rayon: Data parallelism library for multi-threading capabilities.

rand: Library for random number generation.

## Usage

Setup:

Ensure Rust is installed on your system. If not, install it from rust-lang.org.

Running the Tool:

Modify urls.txt to include the list of URLs you want to audit.

Customize the list of search_params and exploit_patterns in src/main.rs based on your audit requirements.

Execution:

Run the tool using cargo run from the project root directory.
View the audit results, including URLs and their corresponding security vulnerabilities.

## Features

Header Analysis: Detects common security risks in HTTP headers like server information, cookies, content types, etc.

Severity Scoring: Assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities based on predefined criteria.

Suggested Improvements: Provides actionable suggestions to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

Parallel Processing: Utilizes multi-threading to process multiple URLs concurrently for faster audits.
